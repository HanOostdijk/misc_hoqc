miscellaneous examples of small projects

Currently it contains two examples with R:

- postcode: shows how to use the Google Maps Geocoding API to get information about an address. The address can be a postal code and the information returned contains e.g. location, country and coordinates
- spatial1: shows how to select municipalities from a map-file and to create a map of these municipalities.
