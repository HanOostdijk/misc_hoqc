# misc_hoqc
Miscellaneous examples of small projects. See my other repositories for more projects

Currently it contains these examples with R (and knitr and RMarkdown):

- postcode: shows how to use the Google Maps Geocoding API to get information about an address. The address can be a postal code and the information returned contains e.g. location, country and coordinates
- spatial1: shows how to select the information from a map-file that is needed for a map of a municipality and the municipalities that surround it. With this information a (ggplot2) map is made.
- spatial2: comparable with spatial2. Here a very detailed 'Kadaster' map is used with many layers to create a customized map of Amstelveen and Schiphol. Features: selection from and combining of map sheets. 
- odata_cbs: this entry (with text in Dutch) describes how to read data from the CBS (Statistics Netherlands, also known as the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics) with the Open Data Protocol. I also describe two questions I still have concerning this protocol in relation with the CBS data.
