# misc_hoqc
Miscellaneous examples of small projects. See my other repositories for more projects

Currently it contains two examples with R (and knitr and RMarkdown):

- postcode: shows how to use the Google Maps Geocoding API to get information about an address. The address can be a postal code and the information returned contains e.g. location, country and coordinates
- spatial1: shows how to select the information from a map-file that is needed for a map of a municipality and the municipalities that surround it. With this information a (ggplot2) map is made.
